# API Documentation for Bookstore 

## Introduction
This document provides a guide on how to use the Sign up and Login API for Owner. The API is hosted at `https://bookstore-0axz.onrender.com/`

### Authentication
Most endpoints in the API require authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). To authenticate, include the `Authorization` header in the request with the JWT. The header should be in the format: Bearer `<token>`, where `<token>` is the JWT obtained during the login process.

## Endpoints
The API has four endpoints:

### Owner Registration
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/owners`

`/signup`: This endpoint is used to create a new owner account. The request should be a POST request with the following parameters:

### Request body :

| Parameter   | Type   | Required | Description                 |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------|
| name        | String | Yes      | The name of the owner.      |
| email       | String | Yes      | The email of the owner.     |
| Password    | String | Yes      | The password of the owner.  |

#### Response :

```json
{
  "status": 201,
  "message": "Owner created successFully",
  "newOwner": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Yaasiin Ahmed",
    "email": "yaskaassoy@gmail.com",

    "updated": "2023-10-02T03:47:42.765Z"
  }
}
```

If the owner already exists, a `409 Conflict` response will be returned. If the request is successful, a `201 Created` response will be returned with the new ownerâ€™s details.

#### Owner Login 
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/owners/login`
This endpoint is used to log in an existing owner. The request should be a POST request with the following parameters:
